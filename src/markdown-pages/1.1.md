Today vast amounts of information are controlled and managed by institutions that we trust to act honestly. Blockchain technology enables a shift from centralized repositories of information of today to more decentralized robust fault-tolerant networks.  

Using blockchain technology, it is possible to imagine a future where we do not rely on centralized organizations to manage our data, but we the users have greater control of our digital lives so how do blockchains enable this? It starts with simple accounting.

Ledger's are a data source that tracks accounts and balances of assets. They are fundamental to accounting and tracking value. Today most Ledgers are maintained in databases run by central authorities such as banks, credit card companies, or governments. Record-keeping by a central authority is beneficial for several reasons, a central authority can maintain data integrity by restricting access to the ledger to authorized users. Also, the data location is known and accessible to the data curators, this allows for fast retrieval and regulating access to the data. Updates to a database are known as transactions.

Transactions need to be atomic where all updates are applied to the ledger, or none of them are. Transactions need to be durable meaning they persist in the system, and there is no chance of the change being reverted. They also need to be consistent. Ledger's data must be modified in a reliable permitted way.

Recently distributed ledger technology has gained popularity. Distributed Ledger does not rely on a central authority to maintain data. Maintaining agreements between the shareholders of the ledger is a difficult problem, data integrity can be maintained using public/private key cryptography, which can verify who initiates transactions and that they are authorized to do so.

Transactions in a distributed ledger must have the same properties as a centralized ledger. They must be atomic durable and consistent, accessing the latest data often takes longer in a distributed ledger system than a centralized one. Because it takes time for the participants to agree on the Ledger's state this also means that the latest transactions are not immediately available to every participant in the network. A ledger is distributed when it has been securely replicated across geographic locations, all distributed Ledger must come to a consensus on the state of the ledger through peer-to-peer protocols. 

Cryptographic infrastructure makes these features technically achievable. Blockchain technology is a version of distributed ledger technology. It implements these features through a specific data structure called a blockchain, and a consensus mechanism called proof-of-work.
